# Is it against TOS?

### Here a direct quote from the [Discord TOS](https://discord.com/terms)
> RIGHTS TO USE THE SERVICE
The Service provides a chat and social platform. The Service may allow you to participate in public and private chat rooms and to utilize messaging features to communicate with other users of the Service. The Service may also allow you to access certain software and/or other content that is available to purchase from the Company. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, the Company grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use and access the Service. You agree not to (and not to attempt to) (i) use the Service for any use or purpose other than as expressly permitted by these Terms;(ii) copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast, attempt to discover any source code, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise exploit the Service or any portion of the Service, except as expressly permitted in these Terms; or (iii) use data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and extraction tools on the Service. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by the Company or its licensors, except for the permissions and rights expressly granted in these Terms.
The Company reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.

If you violate these Terms, the Company reserves the right to issue you a warning regarding the violation or immediately terminate or suspend any or all Accounts you have created using the Service. You agree that the Company need not provide you notice before terminating or suspending your Account(s), but it may do so.

### TL;DR

### Yes.

## HOWEVER

### The Developers of [BD(BetterDiscord)](https://betterdiscord.net) have made it [clear](https://0x71.cc/bd/guide/#ban) that you simply can't get banned if you don't play dumb.

> All signs point to no.
While Bandaged BD does indeed violate the Discord Terms of Service, Discord has not been seen to take action on users for the mere usage of Bandaged BD.
Of the (estimated) over 20 thousand users of Bandaged BD there have been 0 known cases of Discord banning someone just for using it.
As long as you stick to plugins you obtained from the #official-plugin-repo channel in the BetterDiscord server you should be safe from being banned.
